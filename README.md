# Lottery DApp

Welcome to the Lottery DApp GitHub project! This decentralized application (DApp) allows users to participate in a lottery and have a chance to win the pool prize. The lottery winner is chosen once every 30 days, providing a fair and exciting opportunity for participants.

## Getting Started

To access the front-end of the Lottery DApp, please visit the production address:

[https://lottery-ebon.vercel.app/](https://lottery-ebon.vercel.app/)

The front-end is built using React, offering a user-friendly and interactive interface for participating in the lottery.

## Smart Contract

The core functionality of the Lottery DApp is powered by a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract is deployed on the Sepolia testnet, allowing you to interact with it during testing and development.

### Contract Address

`0x86D70Dc2ba9fEc20Aec424aA85c1c246dcecC128`

### Transaction Fee

Each transaction made through the Lottery DApp incurs a fee of 2.5% of the entry amount. This fee is collected and credited to the creator of the lottery.

## How it Works

Here's a brief overview of how the Lottery DApp functions:

1. Users access the front-end application and connect their wallets to the DApp.
2. To participate in the lottery, users submit an entry with a specified amount of funds from their connected wallet.
3. The lottery pool prize accumulates with each entry until the end of the 30-day period.
4. After 30 days, the smart contract automatically selects a winner from the pool of participants, who will receive the entire pool prize.
5. The process then resets, and users can participate in the next round of the lottery.
